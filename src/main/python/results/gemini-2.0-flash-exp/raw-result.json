            "description": "The code uses SecureRandom to generate a 'rememberMeKey' which is then stored as a cookie value and in the session. However, SecureRandom is seeded automatically, and this might lead to predictable random values, especially in containers. If the same seed is used, the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers will be generated, leading to the possibility of hijacking other users cookies by predicting the value. Although there are checks for user validity using the generated cookies, this is a low-impact vulnerability.",
